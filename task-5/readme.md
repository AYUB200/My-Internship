# Task 5: SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

**Objective:** Learn to combine data from multiple tables using SQL joins.

- **LEFT JOIN** : Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table  
- **RIGHT JOIN** : Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table  
- **FULL JOIN** : Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables
