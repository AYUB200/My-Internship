# Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries

**Objective:** Use subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses to perform nested SQL operations.

**Description:**  
Subqueries are queries inside another query. They can return a single value or multiple values and are used to filter, compare, or aggregate data.

**Types:**  
- `=` : Scalar subquery for single value comparison  
- `IN` : Check if a value exists in a list  
- `EXISTS` : Checks if rows exist  
- Correlated subquery : Inner query depends on outer query  
- Subquery in FROM : Creates a temporary table for further use
